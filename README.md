# Xenometon Portfolio Website 🚀

**My first modern, responsive portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!** <br>
_This website is primarily optimized for larger screen formats (Laptop/desktops), you may experience display issues on mobile devices._

## ✨ Features

- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle** - with localStorage persistence
- **Interactive Project Carousel** - with auto-play and manual controls
- **Dynamic Neural network animation** - When you click on the neural network as they steadily appear from the edge of the screen, it will transmit a beautiful gradient pulse across the network.
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation** - with active section highlighting
- **Scroll Animations** along with a scroll-to-top button
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 compliant with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Mobile Hamburger Menu** - for touch-friendly navigation
- **Glassmorphism Design** - A consistent design of frosted glass is followed across all the cards, creating a beautiful separation from foreground and background.
- **Easter Egg** - If you hover on the text 'Xenometon' on the header and the main section, it will gradually turn to gold!
